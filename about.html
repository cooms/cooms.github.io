					<h1>  About Myself  </h1>
					<hr/>
					<p> I always knew the Tech Industry was made for me; even from about the age of 3, I always found myself around a computer of some sort.
					<br/><br/>
					Starting up that first Playstation was the moment my mind started to crave the colourful pixels on screen, and that sense of wonder drove me to learn how everything in front of me was happening.
					<br/><br/>
					Twenty years on and I'm learning how numbers and letters in a text editor can create something amazing in a browser. Sometimes I wonder whether or not this line of work is right for me - but the fascination of how some code creates these amazing things keeps me eager to learn.<br/>It's a never-ending process.</p>
					<br/><br/>
					<!-- Second Block -->
					<h1>  Where I'm at now  </h1>
					<hr/>
					<p> Right now I'm looking to find the right group of people to work with. I've been spending my time learning different web languages, libraries, frameworks and CMS's, and at this point I'm not sure what niche I want to delve into.
					<br/><br/>
					I want to find a place of work where all my expertise and talent could be put to use. It's all good and well being able to do the work, but a challenge is needed in order to improve - that's what I'm looking for.
					<br/><br/>
					<strong>
					If you think I'd make a great addition to your team of developers, please don't hesitate to get in contact!
					</strong>
