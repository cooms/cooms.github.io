        <h2>
          What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The experience is without a doubt very unique. EDA wants all their students to feel they aren't paying for a service or product, but rather invaluable knowledge
          and an unforgetable experience where the whole class feels as if it were a family. This approach, for me, is very new and honestly refreshing after attending other courses where I've paid for tuition that felt either forced, or just wasn't up to scratch.

        <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          When I found DevAcademy on google I had a look at their site and the knew cirriculum was right for me. However when read about other parts of the course (yoga, mindfullness exercises etc.) and their progressive approach to the world, I was a bit skeptical that this place might be a bit too "modern" for me. However after meeting some of the staff and the rest of my cohort I know that it will be an interesting and fun experience getting to learn and work with such a broad group of people.

          How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Ultimately, it will be a new experience for me, but change is good! I'm used to being given assignment, a little bit of an explanation and a "please email me if you need help". But now I'm able to communicate with my cohort at any time and we can work together to make sure that we not only pass, but bring out the best out of
          eachother.

        <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
        <br>
        <p> 
          Nope, I know this will be a bit of a change for me, but EDA will be a great place to study.

        <h2> 
          Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Very excited, the fact that I get a complete change and entirely different experience makes me keen to begin. And yeah everyone's a little nervous when the begin,
          but once you get going, there's nothing stopping you. Same goes for me; I want to strive to do the best I can and leave with an unforgettable experience and knowledge
          that I can use inside and outside the workplace.
