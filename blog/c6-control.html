          <h2> What learnings did you take from chapter 5? </h2>
          <br>
          I learned quite a lot from this chapter. Firstly, a kind of ultimate purpose. I'ts important to find a balance between something that you enjoy doing, and something that's meaningful and purposeful. In a weird way, that's kind of why I got into web; I enjoy creating things, but I also get to contribute to the technical world by offering my knowledge and creating websites and apps to help people.
          <br><br>
          Another thing was the Intrinsic Motivators - Find direction in your life, work to improve on things that matter to you, and use that to serve a purpose greater than yourself. These are all things you can use together in order to help find a stable track to get where you want to be later on.
          <br><br>
          Lastly, discovering the ideal future. It's not good enough to just say to yourself "I want to be ____ when I'm older" - You need to envision yourself in that position, even draw it if you have to. This provides the motivation to get to there if you can actually see that person that you've become. For me, this has helped me stopped being so lazy and unmotivated, I write down where I want to be in 5 years, and what I'm doing, I want people to see me as a positive influence, and make sure I don't make any mistakes that I've already made.

          <h2> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness? </h2>
          <br>
          Really helpful. I spent time brainstorming on my future - Where am I, what am I doing etc. Giving myself insight to who I am later on helps me to priotitize the steps I need to get there.
