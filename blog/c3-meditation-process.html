          <h2> Process over product </h2>
          <br>
          I thought I knew all about this idea until it came right around and kicked me sqaure in the backside. I thought for some reason I wouldn't need the CSS skeleton to help me design my site, and couldn't have been more wrong LOL.<br><br> I applied my knowledge of CSS and tried to make a reaaally good looking site, and it did look good on the desktop. Once I shrunk the page down however, it wasn't a pretty sight. THEN I opened it up on my phone it was just horrific; no mobile compatability at all. That's what I get for jumping right ahead with my pseudo-knowledge, perfect example of why you need to take "process over product" into consideration.<br><br> Looks like I'll need to implement the skeleton after all :^)

          <h2>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2 of "Search Inside Yourself"</h2>
          <br>
          In all honesty, it always kind of sounded cool, but also seemed a bit like a waste of time. It just kind of seemed like one big placebo affect, like hypnosis or something. After listening to the speakers explanation, it started to make more sense, be mindful and note of how your body feels to thoughts, not just your brain.

          <h2> What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h2>
          <br>
          It's actually pretty interesting. To take into account how your body reacts to thoughts is something I would never consider. If I actually tried meditation properly I think it could definitely benefit me.

          <h2> Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h2>
          <br>
           -"Sit like a majestic mountain". If you try this, you might find you can be alert and relaxed at the same time.<br> -Focus on breathing. If you forget the steps to meditate, concentrate on breathing "as if your life depends on it".
