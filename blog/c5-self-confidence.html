          <h2> What is the relationship between mindfulness and Self awareness?</h2>
          <br>
          When becoming mindful, it's important to take time to reflect on yourself. Look at yourself and recognize flaws with an open mind, sure they exist, by is it really that bad? Notice these flaws and slowly work to fix, without shaming yourself for having these flaws to begin with.

          <h2>Explain control flow and loops with an analogy</h2>
          <br>
          Control flow is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: Control of the flow.
          <br><br>
          This can apply to just about anything in a real world example; numbers, people, items etc. Using a loop, one is able to control the flow effectively. For example: You want to type up a blog, you need to enter specific characters in order to finish it and upload it to your site.
          <br><br>
          To do this, you would use a for loop to keep pressing appropriate keys until you've finished the blog to the correct length (blog.length).

          <h2> Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter. What was your experience of it? </h2>
          <br>
          I kept a journal for this week, reflecting on my actions and evaluating myself. It's something I sort of already do, but on a lesser detailed level; I try not to make the same mistake, and try to think about my approach to something before I do it.
          <br><br>
          It's always been a useful exercise for me, but now thinking in more in-depth about my decisions are helping for even better self-evaluation.

          <h2> What did you take away from "My Emotions are Not Me" </h2>
          <br>
          Ultimately what I got from this chapter was that the emotions do define you, but the way you react to them does.
          <br><br>
          Just because something has made you feel angry doesn't necessarily mean you should BE angry. Note the emotion and what has caused it, and then decide how to react.
