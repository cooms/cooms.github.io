          <h2> What did you learn from your 'mindfullness conversation'? How did the other person find it? </h2>
          <br>
          I learned a completely new way to percieve a conversation. It's pretty interesting how the way you listen to someone can change the understanding of information they're giving you, and also in turn, the information you give them.
          <br><br>
          I can sometimes get pretty easily distracted from a conversation, my mind can easily drift if something else enters my mind. Acknowledging that thought and putting it aside for later, however, makes it much easier to concentrate on the conversation at hand.

          <h2>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h2>
          <br>
          -Emotional Awareness
          <br>
          Recognizing an emotion as a feeling that your body emits and acknowledging as something you can analyze can make it easier to understand why that emotion is occuring and how you react to it effectively.
          <br><br>
          -Self Assessment
          <br>
          A lot of people with any sort of ego can struggle to admit to their faults and say "This exists because.... and I can work to fix it by...", taking time to effectively acknowledge assess flaws and work to fix them can improve performance and productivity for whatever it may be.
