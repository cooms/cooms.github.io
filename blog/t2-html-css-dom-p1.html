        <h2>
          How would you describe HTML, CSS and the DOM to a non-technical friend?
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The DOM is the the structure of the house. In your house you have many rooms and objects to place in them, so you need to keep them in organised within objects. For exmaple, you might have a set of coasters, which belong in the top drawer of a chest of drawers, and that chest belongs in the living room, so you would use the DOM to structure them accordingly. 
          <br>
          The CSS is all about positioning, layout and design: where does this go? Where does that go? What color is this wall? How much space do these need between eachother? CSS allows you style all these properties in the house (including the house itself).

          What is boxifying design?
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Boxifying is the process of breaking down a layout into boxes. HTML elements are always rectangular, so they are basically boxes. The DOM also relates to this in that boxes go inside boxes, which might go inside a bigger box.

      <div class="question">
        <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The CSS box model is term used to define html elements. Each element has content, then padding surrounding the content, a border around the padding, and finally a margin to position the box on the page.
