          <h2> What is a responsive site? Why are they important?</h2>
          <br>
          A site is repsonsive when it changes depending on what screen size a user is using. CSS frameworks, media queries and resizing images and just some of the things a developer can do to make a site responsive. <br><br>As technology is progressing at an exponential rate, more and more people are accessing the internet with devices that aren't desktop computers, so we as developers need to make sites that will adapt to those devices. (Note: Google doesn't index sites that aren't repsonive!)

          <h2>Mobile first design</h2>
          <br>
          When creating a site, one has to decide whether they're going to start with the desktop design first or the mobile design. Starting with mobile design, the developer is able to create the site on a smaller scale, and allows them to decide the hierarchy of the content before piecing it together.

          <h2> Frameworks</h2>
          <br>
          Frameworks are essentially a skeleton for you to use when creating the actual layout of your website. They're really useful for building the design without having to apply the trite positioning values and attributes (float, flex etc).<br><br>They also provide a gridded layout so you already have an idea of where the content will go on the page and how much space it will take. On the downside, frameworks can be pretty limited. Sure you can place your content pretty easily, but what happens if you have a detailed and complex idea of how you want your content structured? A framework sometimes just won't cut it. <br><br>However, you can always use the framework and just add your own additional CSS your self to make your site look the way you want it.

          <h2> Wireframe</h2>
          <br>
          Basically a blueprint of your site before you go ahead a build it. It lets you take the design in your head and put it on a page to get a good idea of whether it works or not.
          <br><br>
          Once you start to create your site, the wireframe acts as a useful reference if you ever forget how your design looks.
          <br><br>
          When creating a wireframe, a developer can choose to do it by hand, or use one of the many wireframe tools found online. They can be tricking to get the hang of initially, but once you've familiarised yourself with them, you can make your layout in no time.
          <br><br>
          For me personally, I found the wireframe a pretty simple concept, it allowed me to create a gridded layout to aid my design, and I could also boxify my design as well, making it even easier to see where the content would go.
          <br><br>
