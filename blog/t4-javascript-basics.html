          <h2> How does JS compare to HTML and CSS? </h2>
          <br>
          The best way to describe Javascript, in comparison to HTML and CSS is functionality. The page wont do anything on its own because it's static! Adding in Javascript allows your site to be clever, methods can be used to find an answer that the user can't find on their own.
          <br><br>
          It's also fair to say that JS is pretty much invisible to a non-developer; its functionality is only present when called upon.

          <h2>Explain control flow and loops with an analogy</h2>
          <br>
          Control flow is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: Control of the flow.
          <br><br>
          This can apply to just about anything in a real world example; numbers, people, items etc. Using a loop, one is able to control the flow effectively. For example: You want to type up a blog, you need to enter specific characters in order to finish it and upload it to your site.
          <br><br>
          To do this, you would use a for loop to keep pressing appropriate keys until you've finished the blog to the correct length (blog.length).

          <h2> Accessing data from arrays and object literals</h2>
          <br>
          Essentially, the data in arrays are always ordered: they have a numeeric index ( array[0], array[1] ). Objects however, can contain non-numeric keys, such as property values (favFood: "Pasta")
          <br><br>
          To access an an item in an array, simply call it's index (array[0, 1, 2, 3])
          <br>
          To access properties or the value of these properties you would need to be more specific, using object.firstname to get the literal property "first name", and then object["firstname"] in order to get the value of that property (eg "Tim", "bob")

          <h2> Explain functions in JS</h2>
          <br>
          Functions are basically defined ways of doing something. You may have a function to add people to a group, or maybe remove someone from a group, or delete the group altogether.
          <br><br>
          Of course, the site won't know how to do this by itself, so you need to write functions to let the site know how you want to approach a situation.
