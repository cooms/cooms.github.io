        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence is something that I personally would never even consider in any working environment, I didn't even know it existed untill watching the Search Inside Yourself videos! It's a very interesting concept that I'd definitely like to begin implementing into not only my work habits, but also daily life as well.

        <h2>
          Mindfulness
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          There's always different ways to percieve or analyze a situation, mindfulness seems like an entirely new approach. The fact that certain areas of the brain are triggered in response to different things has always been an interesting concept to me, and learning about how the Amygdala reacts to negative situations really intruiged me as well. It's pretty crazy that we can hijack this part of our brain to change our overall reaction to stressful or negative situations, I can't wait to try this out in hopes that it will help me to work better under pressure.

        <br>
        <p>
          Again, another interesting scientific concept. Being able to mould our own brains to think how we want to is absolutely increadible, imagine the possibilities! Trying this on the Amygdala would definitely be a good first step to trying this concept.

        <h2>Using mindfulness</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          I tried using the mindfulness technique on some work in this sprint-1. It's a completely new conecpt that I haven't quite fully grasped yet, so i found it a bit hard to adjust to, but at the same time it's also really strange and intruiging to try to take a different approach to whatever you're doing. Any thought that came into my head had some sort of positivity or negavitity as usual, but I worked at trying to make them completely indifferent to eachother, which was a little weird, but also kind of made sense to eliminate the initial emotional reaction to the thought, and to think about it from an other perspective.
