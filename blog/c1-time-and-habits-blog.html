          <h2> Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </h2>
          <br>
          I timeboxed for 1 hour to read up on the habits domain. I thought the Pomodoro technique sounded simple enough, so i tried it out. Turns out that allocating 25 minutes to a specific task and that task ALONE is pretty efficient, I was able to sit down, work on my site, commit my work and take a break. Then return and do the same for another 25 minutes. Allocating specific branches of a main task to a Pomodoro could help me or anyone to be much more productive.

          <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
          <br>
          Reading up exactly how meditation works was actually really interesting. I've always been a bit skeptical about it, but reading the scientific points behind it helped me to understand the whole process of meditation. The growth mindset was also pretty intruiging, looking at confidence from a different perpective can really help someone find theirs. I have a feeling this technique will help me to try and master what ever I can during this course, and even afterwards.

          <h2> What worked for you?</h2>
          <br>
          The Pomodoro technique seemed to work especially well. Organising tasks into 25 minute timeslots appears to be an excellent way to manage time and get things done efficiently. I'm already cutting out my work for the next day on a whiteboard every evening, and make sure I get them done. The pomodoro tehcnique will help me to achieve even more now.

          <h2> Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
          <br>
          I will definitely be trying out meditation sometime in the near future and try to use it to make my self more productive.
