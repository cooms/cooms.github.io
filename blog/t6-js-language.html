          <h2> Use of parentheses in Javascript () </h2>
          <br>
          There's a few uses for regular brackets in Javascript, one very important one is the use of parameters in functions (function newFunction(parameterName)), when you call the function you can put an argument in the function brackets to make the function work with that specific argument that you've put in.
          <br><br>
          Another use is mathematics or basic Javascript syntax, eg. ((6 / 2) * (10 % 3)). Since Javascript follows BEDMAS rules, a developer can use this to be able to execute formulas and equations just like a calculator.
          <br><br>
          Last use is basic syntax, to enclose some code in a variable or a function. eg. var blah = Number(anotherFunction(Math.floor(anotherVariable))) or something similar. It makes more sense to use brackets in this way for both the language and the developer.

          <h2> Use of square brackets in Javascript [] </h2>
          <br>
          Brackets are primarily used for referring to arrays' index eg. arrayName[1]. This will refer to the 2nd item in the array (because indexes begin at 0).
          <br><br>
          They are also used for objects, eg var objectName = { objectProperty1: [value] }.

          <h2> And curly braces? {} </h2>
          <br>
          They're mainly used for enclosing a block of code inside something, such as a function, loop or switch eg. function functionName { function code }. Very handy to keep track of which block of code belongs to what function or object.

          <h2> What about 'single quotes' and "Double quotes?" </h2>
          <br>
          Super similar, and serve almost the exact same purpose. If you want to declare any word or sentence as a string, you'll need to put it in quotes, either single or double. It's usually based on the developer's preference, but one would usually start with double quotes, and then if you need to declare another string within that string, then you can throw in the single quotes as well, eg. var stringName = "Here is the string and also 'another string within'".
          <br><br>
          NOTE: When dealing with JSON, double quotes must be used, otherwise you'll run into a few snags down the line.
