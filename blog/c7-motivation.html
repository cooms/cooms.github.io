          <h2> How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens? </h2>
          <br>
          To some degree, I kind of looked at life this way to begin with. When I came out of school I knew I needed to find my path in life and made sure it's something that I wanted to do, so I didn't jump into anything straight away.
          <br><br>
          Once I started getting into IT, that's when I realized I need to not only do something that I enjoy, but also need to do something that serves some sort of purpose as well. Web Dev seems to be right in the middle of Passion and Pleasure for me: I enjoy it and also by building websites I am able to contribute to the world by using my knowledge to produce something that someone else desires.

          <h2> What are your core values? </h2>
          <br>
          Sympathy - Being able to understand someone and their situation to some degree and to view from their persepective
          <br>
          Determination and Tenacity - One thing I struggle with is laziness: I'm probably one of - if not the laziest person I know, so determination and tenacity are huge values and I respect anyone with a drive to do something they're willing or reluctant to do and do keep at it.
          <br>
          Morality - A pretty controversial value, but everyone should always strive to take the high-road and be self-less.

          <h2> What do you stand for? </h2>
          <br>
          Making a difference - Sounds cliche, but I guess the biggest objective in life is to leave the world a better place than it was when you entered it. Even if it's just through coding!

          <h2> Resilience ideas and meditation </h2>
          <br>
          It's something that should come naturally to us - We should always take a calm and collected approach toward things and recognize that even if you failure, you are also succeeding in a way. The mistakes you make build your knowledge, experience and understanding, ensuring that you are much less likely to make that mistake again, if at all.
