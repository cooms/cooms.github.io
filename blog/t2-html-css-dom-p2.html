          Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          As technology is progressing, more and more people are using devices other than desktop computers to access the internet. This means devices like laptops, tablets and smartphones are starting to be used more and more, and they need a different layout of the webpage in order for the user to be able to use the site effectively. Responsive design allows developers to do this by making content responsive to what device the user is using, and the corresponding resolution given.
