For this project I was appointed head of design - my task was to focus on front-end rendering and the general layout of the application. 

Harvestr is built in reactjs, which meant clear communications from all parts of the team was essential in making the application function correctly. 

Because the app is intended to be used on a range of devices, I had to make sure it was responsive before deployment, it now functions perfectly on almost any device. 

We utilized github to manage the project effectively - branching for each feature and merging to a 'dev' branch once a feature had been completed.
The application isn't designed for consumer use, so its authentication only allows admins and members of kiwiharvest to log in and actually use it. 

Once the user has logged in, a list of tickets is displayed showing: 
• The name of the respective organization 
• The expected weight of the pick up or delivery 
• The location (with google map implementation) 
• Whether the organization is a donor or recipient (also depicted by two defining colours) 

A driver is able to view each individual ticket to view any details, they're also able to put in an actual pick-up / drop-off weight and mark the ticket as completed (rendering it grey). 

An operations manager is given the same privilages as the driver, but is also able to create tickets and new donors/recipients as well.

We are still working on Harvestr to this day, recieving feedback from actual use by kiwiharvest members to see what we can change and enhance.
