# Github Profile

This is my github profile. I'm attempting to build it without any frameworks plugins or tools, just my own knowledge.
As of now, I still have a few things that need to be completed.

In no particular order:
1. Fully responsive
* Header needs to be adjusted
* Some wrappers widths need to be adjusted.
* Text must be adjusted according to media queries
2. All projects completed
* Harvestr needs to adjusted with some other text and images need to be re-styled.
* MyLeague needs be added to the page.
3. Need to add about me
* My background.
* My Study background and interest in tech.
* A CV download link.
4. Need to touch up contact page.
* Add my linkedin.
* Add a link to my phone and email.
