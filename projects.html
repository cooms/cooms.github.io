					<h1> My projects </h1>
					<p> Below is a short list of projects I've made with and without my fellow classmates at Enspiral Dev Academy. <br/><br/> Our final project was Harvestr, an app that solves a real world problem in collaboration with a non-profit organization. We are extremely proud of this application and continue to work on it to this day.

					<p> Harvestr was our final project during our time at EDA, our class of 6 worked together to create an app that would help to solve a real world problem.<br/><br/>A class member had previously worked with a company called kiwiharvest, a non-profit organization commited to fetching excess produce and distributing it to those in need.<br/><br/>We wanted to create an application that would help kiwiharvest streamline their operations. We created Harvestr to allow their head communications and drivers to coordinate efficiently through a ticket system.<br/><br/>

					<h1 class=""> Inovo </h1>
					<img class="" src="public/inovoExamples800px.fw.png"/>
					<p> Inovo is the first commercial site I've ever built - I created the entire design, logo and site from scratch. I was fortunate enough to have a client who entrusted me to put all my talents to use in order to create exactly what he was after.<br/><br/>As of now, it is essentially a presence for my client's small business, and also an extensive catalogue of products available for purchase. It is not an e-commerce site just yet, but will evolve into one in the near future.<br/><br/>Inovo is built through Wordpress with a theme I developed, and utilizes several plugins in order to allow the showcasing of particular products, and also allows the user to contact the client directly through NinjaForms.<br/><br/>This site is currently not live, but it will be once all its products have been uploaded.
