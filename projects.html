					<p> Below is a short list of projects I've made with and without my fellow classmates at Enspiral Dev Academy. <br><br> Our final project was Harvestr, an app that solves a real world problem in collaboration with a non-profit organization. We are extremely proud of this application and continue to work on it to this day.

						<h1> Harvestr </h1>
						<p> Harvestr was our final project during our time at EDA, our class of 6 worked together to create an app that would help to solve a real world problem.
						<br><br>
						A class member had previously worked with a company called kiwiharvest, a non-profit organization commited to fetching excess produce and distributing it to those in need.
						<br><br>
						We wanted to create an application that would help kiwiharvest streamline their operations. We created Harvestr to allow their head communications and drivers to coordinate efficiently through a ticket system.

								For this project I was appointed head of design - my task was to focus on front-end rendering and the general layout of the application.
								<br><br>
								Harvestr is built in reactjs, which meant clear communications from all parts of the team was essential in making the application function correctly.
								<br><br>
								Because the app is intended to be used on a range of devices, I had to make sure it was responsive before deployment, it now functions perfectly on almost any device.
								<br><br>
								We utilized github to manage the project effectively - branching for each feature and merging to a 'dev' branch once a feature had been completed.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="harvestInfo">
							<p>
								The application isn't designed for consumer use, so its authentication only allows admins and members of kiwiharvest to log in and actually use it.
								<br><br>
								Once the user has logged in, a list of tickets is displayed showing:
								<br>
									• The name of the respective organization
									<br>
									• The expected weight of the pick up or delivery
									<br>
									• The location (with google map implementation)
									<br>
									• Whether the organization is a donor or recipient (also depicted by two defining colours)
								<br><br>
								A driver is able to view each individual ticket to view any details, they're also able to put in an actual pick-up / drop-off weight and mark the ticket as completed (rendering it grey).
								<br><br>
								An operations manager is given the same privilages as the driver, but is also able to create tickets and new donors/recipients as well.

						<p> We are still working on Harvestr to this day, recieving feedback from actual use by kiwiharvest members to see what we can change and enhance.<br><br>
